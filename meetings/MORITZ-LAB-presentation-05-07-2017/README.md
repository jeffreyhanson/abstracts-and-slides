# Conserving evolutionary processes

A central aim in conservation is to maximize the long-term persistence of biodiversity. To fulfill this aim, protected areas are used to safeguard biodiversity patterns (eg. species, populations) and the processes that sustain them (eg. processes that underpin adaptation). Since the resources available for conservation are limited, the processes of selecting areas for protection is often formulated as an optimization problem. However, most previous efforts have failed to consider intra-specific evolutionary processes when assessing existing protected areas or planning for the establishment of new protected areas. During my PhD, I have investigated ways to incorporate intra-specific adaptive and neutral evolutionary processes into reserve selection. I have also aimed to gain some insight into how well existing protected areas are representing species' capacity to respond to environmental change. My research highlights the need to explicitly consider evolutionary processes in conservation planning.
