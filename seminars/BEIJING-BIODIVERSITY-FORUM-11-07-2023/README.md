Making better conservation decisions

# Summary

Conservation actions are urgently needed to safeguard species and the processes that sustain biodiversity. However, efforts to conserve biodiversity are complicated by the fact that existing information is incomplete and available resources are limited. In this seminar, I will discuss strategies for overcoming these challenges to develop cost-effective conservation plans. I will show how conservation plans can be improved by applying advanced algorithms to optimize decisions, strategically collecting data to reduce uncertainty, and employing cost-effective surrogates when high quality datasets -- such as genetic data -- are too costly. I will illustrate how these strategies can be applied using case studies ranging from the county scale to the global scale. By using cost-effective plans to inform decision making, conservation efforts stand a far greater chance at enhancing the long-term persistence of biodiversity.

Jeffrey Hanson is a postdoctoral scientist in the Bennett Lab at Carleton University, Canada. His research focuses on solving the challenges that prevent us from creating cost-effective plans to conserve biodiversity. He also develops decision support tools to help make his research accessible, such as the prioritizr, raptr, oppr, and surveyvoi R packages.
