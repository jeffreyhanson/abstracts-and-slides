# Making better conservation decisions

## Summary

Conservation actions are urgently needed to safeguard species and the processes that sustain biodiversity. However, efforts to conserve biodiversity are complicated by the fact that existing information is incomplete and available resources are limited. In this seminar, I will discuss strategies for overcoming these challenges to develop cost-effective conservation plans. I will show how conservation plans can be improved by applying advanced algorithms and mobilizing high quality data. I will also showcase the Where to Work tool -- a decision support tool developed in partnership between Carleton University and the Nature Conservancy of Canada -- to inform conservation planning (https://ncc.carleton.ca/). By using cost-effective plans to inform decision making, conservation efforts stand a far greater chance at enhancing the long-term persistence of biodiversity.

## BioStetch

Jeffrey Hanson is a postdoctoral scientist in Professor Joseph Bennett's research group at the Department of Biology, Carleton University. His research focuses on solving the challenges that prevent us from conserving biodiversity. In particular, he specializes in applying advanced algorithms to optimize conservation planning, mobilizing novel datasets to inform conservation decision making, and developing strategies to overcome data limitations. He also develops decision support tools to help make his research accessible for conservation practitioners (e.g. prioritizr, raptr, oppr R packages).
