# Conserving evolutionary processes

## Abstract

Protected areas are used to safeguard biodiversity patterns (e.g. species, populations) and the processes that sustain them (e.g. adaptation, gene flow). Since the resources available for conservation are limited, conservation efforts need to be allocated in a cost effective manner that will maximize biodiversity persistence. However, evolutionary processes are rarely considered when assessing existing protected areas or planning for the establishment of new reserves. During my PhD project, I have developed new methods to incorporate evolutionary processes, such as adaptation, genetic drift, and gene flow, into the reserve selection process. I have also investigated potential surrogates for genetic data, such as environmental variation, geographic distance, and habitat suitability, to prioritize conservation efforts when genetic data are not available. I show that failing to consider evolutionary processes during reserve selection can undermine the long-term success of conservation efforts.

Under the guidance of Richard Fuller and Jonathan Rhodes, Jeff has developed methods to operationalize evolutionary processes for setting conservation priorities. He is passionate about improving the cost-effectiveness of conservation activities. His interests include spatial prioritization, spatial data analysis, species distribution modeling, landscape genetics, and developing open source software.
