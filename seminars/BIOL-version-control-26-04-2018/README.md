# Introduction to project management and version control

## Summary

Have you ever thought to yourself "I can't make any changes to my code, I finally got it working!"? If so, you might benefit from learning about project management and version control methodologies. For as long as programmers have been writing code, they have needed ways to manage different versions of their code. For example, Facebook has teams of people all working on the same project, do you think they have a folder full of files called "fbHomepageV1.html", "fbHomepageV2.html", "fbHomepageV2-working.html"? No, they don't. And neither should you. In this talk, I will introduce you to Git---a free open source distributed version control system---and GitHub---an online software development platform. We will cover the basics: committing changes to a series of files, switching between different versions, creating and managing issues, accepting changes from other people, and handling the dreaded merge conflict. Although Git can be accessed from the terminal, I will be using the GitHub graphical user interface for live demonstrations. So, if you would like to follow along during the talk, please download and install it (available for Windows and Mac OSX at https://desktop.github.com/).
